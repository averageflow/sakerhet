_säkerhet_ - from Swedish, meaning security, certainty

Helpful abstractions to ease the creation of integration tests in Go with some key ideas:

- Tests should be easy to **read, write, run and maintain**
- Using Docker containers with real instances of services (PostgreSQL, NGINX, GCP Pub/Sub, etc) with testcontainers
- Integrate with the standard Go library
